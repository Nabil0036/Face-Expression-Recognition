# Face-Expression-Recognition
This project is about predicting facial expression recognition using convolutional neural network. The dataset here used is [fer2013](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset).
This dataset is extremely noisy thats why i get only 62% accuracy on my test data. Hope data augmentation adn boosting techniques can help to gain some more accuracy

### Prerequisites
```
* Tensorflow == 2.0
* Opencv == 4.3.0
```
